Don't forget to disable any iptables firewalling that would
prevent Calamari host communication.  The below is 
provided for convenient reference; you should read your system
documentation and establish an appropriate level of security as
your site requires.  

The apache processes must be able to write to /opt/calamari/log

Completely disable iptables:

SysVInit:
/etc/init.d/iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off

Upstart:
stop iptables
echo "manual" > /etc/init/iptables.override
